# smartGyro investigation

## Why this exists?
An electric scooter company named smartGyro has scooters that used to be tricked by opening the controller and cutting a current limiting wire, now the controller is sealed with gel to prevent this and the limit is 25 KM/h (15 MPH). 
I would like to research and get this done, I have seen stores that sold a dispay that would deslim this without having to open the skid. Maybe somehow from the APK you can do this.

## Options actually
I've been looking at how to do it, and the only hardware way would be to get a display of the V3 version of smartGyro and its old brusless 800W (1200w pick) controller, which if it can be used, it can be used in the same way as the V3 version of smartGyro.

SmartGyro speedway v3 for example uses this type of LCD-DISPLAY with some firmware i guess

Same as the controllator of the e-scooter
