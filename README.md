# smartGyro investigation

## Why this exists?
An electric scooter company named smartGyro has scooters that used to be tricked by opening the controller and cutting a current limiting wire, now the controller is sealed with gel to prevent this and the limit is 25 KM/h (15 MPH). 
I would like to research and get this done, I have seen stores that sold a dispay that would deslim this without having to open the skid. Maybe somehow from the APK you can do this.
